MAIN
----
1. Configure DCR and get old code sample working + config updated
   Automate writing of JSON, then check in

2. Get ASWebAuthenticationSession window working
   Then add implicit flow messages

3. Move on to Android

4. Strip down old code examples

5. Update mobile website articles and split into Basics + DCR
   Do this after Token Handler Pattern resources have gone live, for reduced merge conflicts
   Fix broken link in iOS AppAuth code example page to repo

MINOR
-----
1. Deal better with startup errors in my code structuring, and creation order
   Config read first, followed by AppAuthHandler created, and config read errors are rendered in the main view
