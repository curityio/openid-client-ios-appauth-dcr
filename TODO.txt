1. Sample needs to be updated to do this:
   Initial registration triggers a code flow
   Code flow logic must be parameterized

CASE 1, getting the dcr access token:
- registration_client_id: mobile_dcr_client
- scope: dcr
- redirect URI: [mobile callback]
- PKCE params

CASE 2, getting the app access token:
- client_id: [from DCR]
- client_secret: [from DCR]
- scope: openid profile
- redirect URI: https://oauth.tools/callback/code
- PKCE params

See if there are any issues using code flow, though should be OK since OAuth tools worked.

2. Get Android sample working also

3. Strip down old code examples in a feature branch

1. Update mobile website articles and split into Basics + DCR
   Do this after Token Handler Pattern resources have gone live, for reduced merge conflicts
   Fix broken link in iOS AppAuth code example page to repo

MINOR
-----
1. Deal better with startup errors in my code structuring, and creation order
   Config read first, followed by AppAuthHandler created, and config read errors are rendered in the main view

2. I had to delete the database image and then verify that the SQL script was initialized ok:
   docker image rm postgres:13.2
   export PGPASSWORD=Password1 && psql -p 5432 -d idsvr -U postgres
